this is an Mini os that, you know, acts like the linux
terminal and have many features like
file manger, math, cmd, google search(or duckduckgo tbh)

IF any features were added, please add it to the help code.(line 233)

IF possible, optimize the code as much as you could and document the new code
with this format:
#---func_name---#
#author: {author} the changes
(the code)
#---func_name---end#

in the main() function:
#---app_name---#
if user_input == "{file command}":
    {call the function}
#---app_name---<end>#

IF possible, use "rich" anywhere you edit.
